Q1	First I want more weeks of data, because making trend or finding pattern in the small data would be inaccurate?
	
Q2	I also want to collect data, where employees would score their teammates personality, so we can get idea about how much they are compatible with their teammates. But the data should be collected anonymous, so there would be no friction between them about scoring each other.
	
Q3	"How much employee would score their employers in terms of providing instructions and 
cooperation when asked for assistance."
	
Q4	Do Employees feels overworked or indirectly forced to do overwork?
	
Q5	How much far the employees lives from their office, because if they live far away then it could be a major reason that they are not that interested in their work?
